Technologies:
Flutter,
MongoDB / mYSQL (INDEXING): we can store the data as light weight. Like : Ticket booking details and user registration details.
We will need Aws service to serve this and it helps to load balance.
Google Location API services,
Need a payment gateway : like payhere

We can use a seperate backend -> laravel with endpoints : mobile , web view for Staff ,
